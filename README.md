# WebSocketAndroidClientDemo
Simple Android Web Socket Client that register units to the server. I tried to implement simple MVP pattern as a way of practice.

How to Test:
Change between the two gradle flavors presented in the application build variants

(NormalMode) -> Simple app test without web socket integration/n
(WebSocketMode) -> Web socket integration activated, server project needed to make this mode work.

Pending Stuff:
- Remove Units
- Modify Units
- Design fixes

[CHANGELOG]
v1.0
- The application can list units and register them in both normal/webSocket mode
